# Foundry Fund Me

## Introduction

Welcome to the Foundry Fund Me project! This repository serves as a companion to the Foundry Course and includes additional comments and explanations to help beginners follow along and understand the code more effectively. Whether you're new to Web3 development or looking to deepen your understanding, this project will guide you through the process of building and deploying smart contracts using Foundry.

Like many of you, I am also on my journey into Web3. The comments and insights included in this repository have been invaluable in helping me conceptualize and better understand the project. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me here or via my X handle listed on my profile.
